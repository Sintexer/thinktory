# *Thinktory Specification*

Thinktory is a learning application that organizes knowledge into concepts, each consisting of a theory, title, and a set of questions. Users learn concepts through quizzes generated by the app, which prioritizes concepts that users have answered less frequently. Users self-assess their answers, providing feedback that the app uses to track progress.
